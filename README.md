# no-build-react
Playing around w/ building apps w/ no build step

## Concepts:

This is really just a playground to expiriment with Native ES Modules.

Pika CDN - https://www.pika.dev/cdn - does some magic to convert javascript from NPM's registry to ES Modules that we can require directly in the browser.
HTM - https://github.com/developit/htm - Allows us to write JSX like syntax without a build step.
